# movie-library-app

First, I create the backend with Nest.js. I add Nest to my global dependencies through

npm i -g @nestjs/cli

And then I create the server/backend folder with the help of Nest

nest new server

Nest creates an app with TS files so we can work with Typescript

Second, I create the frontend folder with this command:

npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript

When the installation ends, I install some libraries: React Hook Form, MUI styled components, Redux Toolkit
